Problem Statement: Customer Transaction Fraud Analysis


 Banks process thousands of customer transactions every day.
 Most transactions are genuine, but some can be fraudulent,
 causing financial loss to the bank and its customers.
 Detecting these suspicious transactions early is
 important to reduce risk and protect customers.


In this project, a dataset of customer transactions is provided.
Each transaction includes information such as amount, type,
customer details, and whether it was fraudulent or not.

As a data analyst, the task is to:

Explore and understand the transaction dataset

Identify patterns in normal and fraudulent transactions

Build a model to predict the likelihood of fraud for any transaction

Create a simple function that takes transaction details as
   input and outputs a fraud risk score or prediction

This project demonstrates how data analysis and basic machine
 learning can be applied in banking to detect fraud and support risk management decisions.
